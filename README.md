# YouTube Knowledge Graph for Obsidian

A plugin for Obsidian that creates a knowledge graph from YouTube video content. It automatically extracts transcripts, analyzes themes and topics using Claude AI, and builds a interconnected network of notes that you can explore through Obsidian's graph view.

## Features

- Automatically detects YouTube links in notes
- Extracts video transcripts (supports multiple methods including manual input)
- Uses Claude AI to analyze content and extract key themes
- Creates theme-based connections between videos
- Integrates with Obsidian's native graph visualization
- Supports manual transcript input when automatic extraction fails

## Installation

1. Copy the `main.js` and `manifest.json` files to your Obsidian plugins folder:
   `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-youtube-knowledge-graph/`

2. Enable the plugin in Obsidian Settings â†’ Community Plugins

3. Configure your Anthropic API key in the plugin settings

## Usage

1. Create a new note with a YouTube video link
2. Use any of these methods to process the video:
   - The plugin will automatically process new notes with YouTube links
   - Run "Process YouTube Links in Current Note" from the command palette
   - Use "Input Manual Transcript" command if automatic transcript extraction fails

3. The plugin will:
   - Create a transcript note
   - Extract themes and create a summary
   - Create theme notes in a Themes/ folder
   - Link everything together in Obsidian's graph

## Commands

- `Process YouTube Links in Current Note`: Processes any YouTube links in the current note
- `Input Manual Transcript`: Opens a new note where you can manually paste a video transcript

## Requirements

## Known Issues
